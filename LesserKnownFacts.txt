Treatment of Palestinians within the occupied territories and to a lesser extent in Israel itself have drawn widespread accusations that it is guilty of apartheid, a crime against humanity under the Rome Statute and the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid.[380][381] The Washington Post's 2021 survey of scholars and academic experts on the Middle East found an increase from 59% to 65% of these scholars describing Israel as a "one-state reality akin to apartheid".[382][383] The claim that Israel's policies for Palestinians within Israel amount to apartheid has been affirmed by Israeli human rights organization B'tselem and international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.[381][384] Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din has also accused Israel of apartheid.[384] Amnesty's claim was criticised by politicians and representatives from Israel and its closest allies such as, the US,[385] the UK,[386] the European Commission,[387] Australia,[388] Netherlands[389] and Germany,[390] while said accusations were welcomed by Palestinians[391] and the Arab League.[392] In 2022, Michael Lynk, a Canadian law professor appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council said that the situation met the legal definition of apartheid, and concluded: "Israel has imposed upon Palestine an apartheid reality in a post-apartheid world".[393][394] Subsequent reports from his successor, Francesca Albanese and from Permanent United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Israel Palestine conflict chair Navi Pillay echoed the opinion.[395][396]

In February 2024, The ICJ held public hearings in regards to the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory including East Jerusalem. During the hearings, 24 states and three international organizations said that Israeli practices amount to a breach of the prohibition of apartheid and/or amount to prohibited acts of racial discrimination.[397] The International Court of Justice in its 2024 advisory opinion found that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories constitutes systemic discrimination and is in breach of Article 3 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid. The opinion is silent as to whether the discrimination amounts to apartheid; individual judges were split on the question.[398][399][400][401][402][403]

Israel maintains diplomatic relations with 165 UN member states, as well as with the Holy See, Kosovo, the Cook Islands and Niue. It has 107 diplomatic missions;[404] countries with which it has no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries.[405] Six out of 22 nations in the Arab League have normalized relations with Israel. Israel remains formally in a state of war with Syria, a status that dates back uninterrupted to 1948. It has been in a similarly formal state of war with Lebanon since the end of the Lebanese Civil War in 2000, with the Israel–Lebanon border remaining unagreed by treaty.

Despite the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt, Israel is still widely considered an enemy country among Egyptians.[406] Iran withdrew its recognition of Israel during the Islamic Revolution.[407] Israeli citizens may not visit Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen without permission from the Ministry of the Interior.[408] As a result of the 2008–09 Gaza War, Mauritania, Qatar, Bolivia, and Venezuela suspended political and economic ties with Israel,[409] though Bolivia renewed ties in 2019.[410]

The United States and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognize the State of Israel, having declared recognition roughly simultaneously.[411] Diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were broken in 1967 following the Six-Day War and renewed in 1991.[412] The United States regards Israel as its "most reliable partner in the Middle East",[413] based on "common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests".[414] The US has provided $68 billion in military assistance and $32 billion in grants to Israel since 1967, under the Foreign Assistance Act (period beginning 1962),[415] more than any other country for that period until 2003.[415][416][417] Most surveyed Americans have held consistently favorable views of Israel.[418][419] The United Kingdom is seen as having a "natural" relationship with Israel because of the Mandate for Palestine.[420] By 2007, Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to Israel and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors.[421] Israel is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy.[422]

Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991,[423] Turkey has cooperated with the Jewish state since its recognition of Israel in 1949. Turkey's ties to other Muslim-majority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel.[424] Relations took a downturn after the 2008–09 Gaza War and Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla.[425] Relations between Greece and Israel have improved since 1995 after decline of Israeli–Turkish relations.[426] The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece's Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise. The joint Cyprus-Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the Leviathan gas field are an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with Cyprus.[427] Cooperation in the world's longest submarine power cable, the EuroAsia Interconnector, has strengthened Cyprus–Israel relations.[428]

Azerbaijan is one of the few majority Muslim countries to develop strategic and economic relations with Israel.[429] Kazakhstan also has an economic and strategic partnership with Israel.[430] India established full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 and has fostered a strong military, technological and cultural partnership with the country since then.[431] India is the largest customer of the Israeli military equipment, and Israel is the second-largest military partner of India after Russia.[432] Ethiopia is Israel's main ally in Africa due to common political, religious and security interests.[433]

Foreign aid
Israel has a history of providing emergency foreign aid and humanitarian response to disasters across the world.[434] In 1955 Israel began its foreign aid programme in Burma. The programme's focus subsequently shifted to Africa.[435] Israel's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1957 with the establishment of Mashav, the Israel's Agency for International Development Cooperation.[436] In this early period, whilst Israel's aid represented only a small percentage of total aid to Africa, its programme was effective in creating goodwill; however, following the 1967 war relations soured.[437] Israel's foreign aid programme subsequently shifted its focus to Latin America.[435]

Since the late 1970s Israel's foreign aid has gradually decreased, although in recent years Israel has tried to reestablish aid to Africa.[438] There are additional Israeli humanitarian and emergency response groups that work with the government, including IsraAid, a joint programme run by Israeli organizations and North American Jewish groups,[439] ZAKA,[440] The Fast Israeli Rescue and Search Team,[441] Israeli Flying Aid,[442] Save a Child's Heart[443] and Latet.[444] Between 1985 and 2015, Israel sent 24 delegations of their search and rescue unit the Home Front Command to 22 countries.[445] Currently Israeli foreign aid ranks low among OECD nations, spending less than 0.1% of its GNI on development assistance.[446] The country ranked 38th in the 2018 World Giving Index.[447]

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is the sole military wing of the Israeli security forces and is headed by its Chief of the General Staff, the Ramatkal, subordinate to the Cabinet. The IDF consists of the army, air force and navy. It was founded during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War by consolidating paramilitary organizations—chiefly the Haganah.[448] The IDF also draws upon the resources of the Military Intelligence Directorate (Aman).[449] The IDF have been involved in several major wars and border conflicts, making it one of the most battle-trained armed forces in the world.[450]

Most Israelis are conscripted at age 18. Men serve two years and eight months, and women serve two years.[451] Following mandatory service, Israeli men join the reserve forces and usually do up to several weeks of reserve duty every year until their forties. Most women are exempt from reserve duty. Arab citizens of Israel (except the Druze) and those engaged in full-time religious studies are exempt, although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention.[452][453] An alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is Sherut Leumi, or national service, which involves a programme of service in social welfare frameworks.[454] A small minority of Israeli Arabs also volunteer in the army.[455] As a result of its conscription programme, the IDF maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and 465,000 reservists, giving Israel one of the world's highest percentage of citizens with military training.[456]


Iron Dome is the world's first operational anti-artillery rocket defense system.
The military relies heavily on high-tech weapons systems designed and manufactured in Israel as well as some foreign imports. The Arrow missile is one of the world's few operational anti-ballistic missile systems.[457] The Python air-to-air missile series is often considered one of the most crucial weapons in its military history.[458] Israel's Spike missile is one of the most widely exported anti-tank guided missiles in the world.[459] Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile air defense system gained worldwide acclaim after intercepting hundreds of rockets fired by Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip.[460][461] Since the Yom Kippur War, Israel has developed a network of reconnaissance satellites.[462] The Ofeq programme has made Israel one of seven countries capable of launching such satellites.[463]

Israel is widely believed to possess nuclear weapons[464] and per a 1993 report, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction.[465][needs update] Israel has not signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons[466] and maintains a policy of deliberate ambiguity toward its nuclear capabilities.[467] The Israeli Navy's Dolphin submarines are believed to be armed with nuclear missiles offering second-strike capability.[468] Since the Gulf War in 1991, all homes in Israel are required to have a reinforced security room, Merkhav Mugan, impermeable to chemical and biological substances.[469]

Since Israel's establishment, military expenditure constituted a significant portion of the country's gross domestic product, with peak of 30.3% of GDP in 1975.[470] In 2021, Israel ranked 15th in the world by total military expenditure, with $24.3 billion, and 6th by defense spending as a percentage of GDP, with 5.2%.[471] Since 1974, the United States has been a particularly notable contributor of military aid.[472] Under a memorandum of understanding signed in 2016, the U.S. is expected to provide the country with $3.8 billion per year, or around 20% of Israel's defense budget, from 2018 to 2028.[473] Israel ranked 9th globally for arms exports in 2022.[474] The majority of Israel's arms exports are unreported for security reasons.[475] Israel is consistently rated low in the Global Peace Index, ranking 134th out of 163 nations in 2022.
