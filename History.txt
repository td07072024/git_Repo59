Prehistory
Further information: Prehistory of the Levant
Early hominin presence in the Levant, where Israel is located, dates back at least 1.5 million years based on the Ubeidiya prehistoric site.[45] The Skhul and Qafzeh hominins, dating back 120,000 years, are some of the earliest traces of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa.[46] The Natufian culture, which may have been linked to Proto-Afroasiatic language,[47][48] emerged by the 10th millennium BCE,[49] followed by the Ghassulian culture by around 4,500 BCE.[50]

Bronze and Iron Ages
Main article: History of ancient Israel and Judah
Early references to "Canaanites" and "Canaan" appear in Near Eastern and Egyptian texts (c. 2000 BCE); these populations were structured as politically independent city-states.[51][52] During the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE), large parts of Canaan formed vassal states of the New Kingdom of Egypt.[53] As a result of the Late Bronze Age collapse, Canaan fell into chaos, and Egyptian control over the region collapsed.[54][55]

A people named Israel appear for the first time in the Merneptah Stele, an ancient Egyptian inscription which dates to about 1200 BCE.[56][57][fn 5][59] Ancestors of the Israelites are thought to have included ancient Semitic-speaking peoples native to this area.[60]: 78–79  Modern archaeological accounts suggest that the Israelites and their culture branched out of the Canaanite peoples through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on Yahweh.[61][62] They spoke an archaic form of Hebrew, known as Biblical Hebrew.[63] Around the same time, the Philistines settled on the southern coastal plain.[64][65]

Most modern scholars agree that the Exodus narrative in the Torah and Old Testament did not take place as depicted; however, some elements of these traditions do have historical roots.[66][67] There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power. While it is unclear if there was a United Kingdom of Israel,[68][69] historians and archaeologists agree that the northern Kingdom of Israel existed by ca. 900 BCE[70]: 169–195  and the Kingdom of Judah by ca. 850 BCE.[71][72] The Kingdom of Israel was the more prosperous of the two and soon developed into a regional power, with a capital at Samaria;[73][74][75] during the Omride dynasty, it controlled Samaria, Galilee, the upper Jordan Valley, the plain of Sharon and large parts of Transjordan.[74]

The Kingdom of Israel was conquered around 720 BCE by the Neo-Assyrian Empire.[76] The Kingdom of Judah, under Davidic rule with its capital in Jerusalem, later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire. It is estimated that the region's population was around 400,000 in the Iron Age II.[77] In 587/6 BCE, following a revolt in Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar II besieged and destroyed Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple,[78][79] dissolved the kingdom and exiled much of the Judean elite to Babylon.[80]

Classical antiquity
Main article: Second Temple period
After capturing Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Empire, issued a proclamation allowing the exiled Judean population to return to Judah.[81][82] The construction of the Second Temple was completed c. 520 BCE.[81] The Achaemenids ruled the region as the province of Yehud Medinata.[83] In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great conquered the region as part of his campaign against the Achaemenid Empire. After his death, the area was controlled by the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires as a part of Coele-Syria. Over the ensuing centuries, the Hellenization of the region led to cultural tensions that came to a head during the reign of Antiochus IV, giving rise to the Maccabean Revolt of 167 BCE. The civil unrest weakened Seleucid rule, and in the late 2nd century the semi-autonomous Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea arose, eventually attaining full independence and expanding into neighboring regions.[84][85][86]

The Roman Republic invaded the region in 63 BCE, first taking control of Syria, and then intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War. The struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian factions in Judea led to the installation of Herod the Great as a dynastic vassal of Rome. In 6 CE, the area was annexed as the Roman province of Judaea; tensions with Roman rule led to a series of Jewish–Roman wars, resulting in widespread destruction. The First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE) resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple and a sizable portion of the population being killed or displaced.[87]

A second uprising known as the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) initially allowed the Jews to form an independent state, but the Romans brutally crushed the rebellion, devastating and depopulating Judea's countryside.[87][88][89][90][91] Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony (Aelia Capitolina), and the province of Judea was renamed Syria Palaestina.[92][93] Jews were expelled from the districts surrounding Jerusalem.[94][90] Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence, and Galilee became its religious center.
